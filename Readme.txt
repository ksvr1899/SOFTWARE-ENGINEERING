I have used sypder(anaconda3) with python for developing this project.
I have explained the code compilation and run steps here.

The developed python code tested on python version Python 3.10.2
Here I have developed two different files
1. stringsandwords.py[Main file]
2. operations.py


 

Compilation

Step 1
	Please install the python nltk library using the command pip install nltk inside terminal.

Run

Step 1
	Please run the code once for downloading the punkt resource.

Step 2
	Run the code again adn provide the input[filename.txt]. You will be able to see the output. Make sure the input file should be in the project folder.

Step 3:
	Provid  the inputs ie.,word to be replaced and replacing word. The sytem will write back to the file.
